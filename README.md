A web-application for managing tasks. These are some of the tutorials I followed when trying this out:

CRUD:
* https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-ruby-on-rails-project-with-a-react-frontend
* https://medium.com/quick-code/simple-rails-crud-app-with-react-frontend-using-react-rails-gem-b708b89a9419

Tags:

Note: This only works with react-router-dom version 5.1. Installation is as follows:
```
yarn add react-router-dom@5.1 bootstrap jquery popper.js
```
